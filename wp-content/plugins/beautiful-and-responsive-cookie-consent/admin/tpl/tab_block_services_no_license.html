    <strong>Service Blocking</strong> makes it easy to block third-party services that install
    cookies, but that comfort comes with a price: it may not be able to block all services and it
    might remove other assets by accident which were not intended to be removed. Please make sure,
    that your settings are properly tested on a test system before applying them to production.
    There is no warrenty that it will work in all situations. In some edge cases it might even break
    your site.
