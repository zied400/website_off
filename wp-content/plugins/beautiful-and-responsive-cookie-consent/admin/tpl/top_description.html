<p>
  This plugin uses the very great open source cookie consent banner solution from osano:
  <a href="https://github.com/osano/cookieconsent/tree/master" target="_blank">github link</a>
  BUT only as basis. In this wordpress plugin version there were some adjustements.<br />
  If you have feature requests or problems let me know.

<p>
  You want to have a link in your data privacy page to show banner again? Use this shortcode:
  [cc_show_cookie_banner_nsc_bar]
