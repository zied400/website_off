    <h3>Description & Credits</h3>
    <div class="nsc_bar_inside_text">
      This plugin uses the very great open source cookie consent banner solution from osano:
      <a href="https://github.com/osano/cookieconsent/tree/master" target="_blank">github link</a>
      BUT only as basis. In this wordpress plugin version there were some adjustements.<br />
      If you have feature requests or problems let me know.
      <p>
        You want to have a link in your data privacy page or anywhere else on your page to show
        banner again? Use this shortcode:
        <strong>[cc_show_cookie_banner_nsc_bar]</strong>
      </p>
